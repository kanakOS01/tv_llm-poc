TÃ¶lvera is a Python library designed for composing together and interacting with basal agencies, inspired by fields such as artificial life (ALife) and self-organising systems. It provides creative coding-style APIs that allow users to combine and compose various built-in behaviours, such as flocking, slime mold growth, and swarming, and also author their own.

                    Overview of Features : 
tv.v: a collection of "vera" (beings) including Move, Flock, Slime and Swarm, with more being continuously added. Vera can be combined and composed in various ways.
tv.p: extensible particle system. Particles are divided into multiple species, where each species has a unique relationship with every other species, including itself
tv.s: n-dimensional state structures that can be used by "vera", including built-in OSC and IML creation (see below).
tv.px: drawing library including various shapes and blend modes, styled similarly to p5.js etc.
tv.osc: Open Sound Control (OSC) via iipyper, including automated export of OSC schemas to JSON, XML, Pure Data (Pd), Max/MSP (SuperCollider TBC).
tv.iml: Interactive Machine Learning via anguilla.
tv.ti: Taichi-based simulation and rendering engine. Can be run "headless" (without graphics).
tv.cv: computer vision integration based on OpenCV and Mediapipe.
